## üß† AI Components

The application uses several AI components:

- **LangChain Agent**: Coordinates between user commands and available tools
- **Azure OpenAI**: Provides the language understanding capabilities
- **Zero-shot Classification**: Used for PDF categorization
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Processes PDF content for analysis

## üì¶ Dependencies

- langchain
- pydantic
- python-dotenv
- PyPDF2
- pdfplumber
- transformers
- shutil
- zipfile

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

- **Caution**: Operations like delete are immediate and cannot be undone
- The application will ask for confirmation for destructive operations
- Use relative paths when possible to avoid accidental system-wide changes

## üîí Privacy

This application processes files locally. When categorizing PDFs or using other AI features, text extraction is performed locally, but content analysis may be processed through the Azure OpenAI API.
